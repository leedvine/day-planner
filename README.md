## Overview

Create a simple calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

Use the [Moment.js](https://momentjs.com/) library to work with date and time. to display the date but also to determine the current hour and style the page accordingly based on this.

Make the page responsive and functional across screen sizes.
